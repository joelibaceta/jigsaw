# Game 02

## Context

A service named YOLO synchronously calls an API named WTF. WTF tends to be very unstable, having latency peaks every now and then that end in response timeouts. If too many timeouts pile up, YOLO's servers may overload and suddenly go down.

## Constraints

- YOLO only waits up to 30 seconds for each call made to WTF.
- YOLO's server has a limited capacity of 10 simultaneous requests.
- YOLO has at least 5 requests per second.
- YOLO is using the best server in the market.
- YOLO needs to make synchronous calls to WTF in each request.

## Challenge

You're required to design an architecture using design patterns that allow YOLO to find out when WTF is having trouble processing requests. Ideally, this architecture should let YOLO know when to stop issuing calls to WTF until WTF is available again.

Be sure to answer this question by outlining the concepts used to tackle the problem, as well as all meaningful interactions between the architecture's components. No programming is required!

**Patterns Used:**

- State
- Observer
- Builder
- ChainOfResponsability

> **Notes**
> - I choose a SocketServer instead of HttpWebServer to avoid frontend pooling to know if the transaction is already processed.
> - I use a queue to keep waiting all the requests to exceds the 10 request processing limit instead of cancel the request or return a "server busy" message.
> - I'm trying to be technology agnostic.
> - I'm using a closure approach to save the callbacks context reducing the dependencies.

**Using Sample**

```php

// WTF Service

defaultAction($message, $connection) {

    $request = $this->parseRequest($message);

    $request->onPendingCallback = function ($request) {
        $connection->sendMessage("Your request has been processing");
    }

    $request->onSuccess = function ($request) {
        $connection->sendMessage($request.body);
    }

    $provider->doRequest($request);

}

```
